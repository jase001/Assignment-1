<h1>MY FIRST WEBPAGE</h1>

<!--Question 2-->
<p1>Following an eighth-place finish in the 1969–70 season and a poor start to the 1970–71 season, Busby was persuaded to
    temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, 
    Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in
    December 1972.[37] Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974;
    by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.[33] The team won promotion at the first attempt 
    and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating 
    Liverpool 2–1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club
    physiotherapist's wife. Dave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, 
    including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to win any trophies; they 
    finished second in 1979–80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup Final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though
    the team won the last seven games under his direction.[39] He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke 
    the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from his former club West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson,
    Manchester United won the FA Cup in 1983 and 1985 and beat rivals Liverpool to win the 1983 Charity Shield. In
    1985–86, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league but finished in
    fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed
    Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal,[41] and guided 
    the club to an 11th-place finish in the league.[42] Despite a second-place finish in 1987–88, the club was back in 
    11th place the following season.Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was saved by victory
    over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final. The following season, Manchester United claimed their first UEFA
    Cup Winners' Cup title. That triumph allowed the club to compete in the European Super Cup for the first time, where
    United beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1–0 at Old Trafford. The club appeared in two consecutive League 
    Cup finals in 1991 and 1992, beating Nottingham Forest 1–0 in the second to claim that competition for the first time
    as well.[40] In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957,
    it won a second consecutive title – alongside the FA Cup – to complete the first "Double" in the club's history.United
    then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995–96,before
    retaining the league title once more in 1996–97 with a game to spare</p1>

<p2>
    <b>Chemistry</b>, the science that deals with the properties, composition, and structure of substances<strong>(defined as elements
    and compounds)</strong>, the transformations they undergo, and the <small>energy</small> that is released or absorbed during these processes. 
    Every substance, whether naturally occurring or artificially produced, consists of one or more of the hundred-odd 
    species of atoms that have been identified as <em>elements</em>. <mark>Although</mark> these atoms, in turn, are composed of more elementary
    particles, they are the basic building blocks of chemical substances; there is no quantity of oxygen, mercury, or gold,
    for example, smaller than an atom of that substance. Chemistry, therefore, is concerned not with the subatomic domain
    but with the properties of atoms and the laws governing their combinations and how the knowledge of these properties
    can be used to <i>achieve specific purposes</i>.<del>NB:</del><ins>Recall:</ins> Water(H<sub>2</sub>O) is a compound. <br>
